Contributing documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly, we clone the main `nilmtk` repository::

	cd ~/git
	git clone https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk/

In the same location clone the `nilmtksite` repository::

	cd ~/git
	git clone https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk.github.io

Now, move back to the main repository::

	cd ~/nilmtk

As usual make changes to .rst files in `~/git/nilmtk/docs/source` to contribute to documentation. 

Build your documentation::

	make html

If everything is configured properly you will see your changes in `nilmtk.github.io` repo under the `nilmtk` folder. 

Commit your changes and push. These changes are reflected in the master
branch of `nilmtk` a these are changes to the source. ::

	git commit -m "your message"
	git push

Next, move to the `nilmtk.github.io` repo::

	cd ~/git/nilmtk.github.io/nilmtk

Commit your changes::

	git add .
	git commit -m "rebuilt docs"
	git push

Thats all! Please allow a time upto 10 minutes for your new docs to appear on the official documentation site.
